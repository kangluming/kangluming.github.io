In the workplace, HSPs, Highly Sensitive Persons, are often the highest performers,
yet the first to burn out and they can struggle in relationships, as they lean towards people-pleasing. <br>
在工作场所，高度敏感人群通常业绩最佳，但也往往最先精疲力竭，他们可能会在人际关系中挣扎，因为他们倾向于取悦他人。<br>
But the story is not a pessimistic one, as the ability to connect is of huge value and higher sensitivity is linked with creativity, brilliance and higher IQ. <br>
但这并不是一个悲观的故事，因为建立联系的能力价值巨大，更高的敏感性与创造力、才华和更高的智商相关。<br>
The trait is shared by pioneers across science, business and the arts—anyone who notices details others don’t, makes connections they can’t.<br>
这种特质为科学、商业和艺术领域的先驱所共有——任何能注意到别人没有注意到的细节的人，都能建立起他人无法建立的联系。

What’s different this time is that unions have regained community support: in LA, teachers were supportive of the staff workers’ strike, and many parents were, too. <br>
这次的不同之处在于，工会重新获得了社区支持：在洛杉矶，教师们支持行政人员罢工，而且许多家长也支持。<br>
“Parents were in the loop from the beginning,” says Conrado Guerrero, president of one of the local unions that led the picketing during the strike in Los Angeles.<br>
“父母从一开始就参与其中，”洛杉矶罢工期间领导纠察队的一家当地工会的主席康拉多·格雷罗说。 <br>
“And they understood that in order for their children to have a better experience in schools, they need us to be able to live here without having to work multiple jobs, without having to worry about, you know, ‘Where is my next meal going to come from?’”<br>
“他们明白，为了让自己的孩子在学校有更好的体验，他们需要我们能够住在这里，而不必身兼多职，也不必担心，你知道，‘我的下一顿饭在哪儿？'”<br>
